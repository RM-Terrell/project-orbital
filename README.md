# Project Orbital

**Ever get tired of doing the same math over and over again manually?**
Orbital is a pet project of mine meant to ease typical day to day math and chicken scratch note taking I do, along with a Pomodoro timer system set up exactly how I want it. Many of these things I'm sure have been done by other people in better ways but I have been wanting to learn Electron and Node.js, so I'm solving this the hard way.

## Framework
Orbital is built in the Electron framework using Bootstrap, jQuery, and TypeScript. As such it **should** be fully cross platform compatible with MacOS, Windows, and Linux.

## Up and Coming
- Scientific calculator.
- Decimal place selection for stats conversions.
- Being able to keep the Pomodoro timer running while using the rest of the app.

## To Use
Currently there is an issue when trying to download the built version of the app and run on windows. Use "npm start" until I wack-a-mole this issue.

## License
Totally open. Go nuts.
