# Project Orbital

**Ever get tired of doing the same math over and over again manually?**
Orbital is a pet project of mine meant to ease typical day to day math and chicken scratch note taking I do, along with a Pomodoro timer system set up exactly how I want it. Many of these things I'm sure have been done by other people in better ways but I have been wanting to learn Electron and Node.js, so I'm solving this the hard way.

## Framework
Orbital is built in the Electron framework with Bootstrap and jQuery. As such it **should** be fully cross platform compatible with MacOS, Windows, and Linux.

## To Use
No installer or executable yet. Still working on that. Will update when available. For now to run the project, clone or download the repo. Then use "npm install" to install dependencies followed by "npm start" to launch.

## License
Totally open. Go nuts.
