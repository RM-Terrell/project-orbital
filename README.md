# Project Orbital

**Ever get tired of doing the same math over and over again manually?**

Orbital is a pet project of mine meant to ease typical day to day math and chicken scratch note taking I do, along with a Pomodoro timer system set up exactly how I want it. Many of these things I'm sure have been done by other people in better ways but since I have been wanting to learn Electron and Node.js better this seemed like a good project.

## Framework
Orbital is built in the Electron framework. As such it **should** be fully cross platform compatible with MacOS, Windows, and Linux.

## To Use
No installer or executable yet. Still working on that. Wil update when available.

# License
Totally open. Go nuts.
