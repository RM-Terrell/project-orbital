# Project Orbital

This project originally began as my very first programming project ever. The company I was employed at back then staffed many data analysts who had a fair amount of statistical conversions and math they needed to do on a day to day basis. As these things go, everyone had their own methods for doing these conversions, from Excel to Mathematica, to old fashion handheld calculators.

Thus I made a super basic HTML / CSS / JS page that did the math in a consistent, standardized manner. It eventually grew into a hare brained Electron app because I didn't know any better. This is the origin of the name "Project Orbital".

The repo has now been reborn as a Django, React app that does the same original conversions.
