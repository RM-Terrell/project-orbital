# Project Orbital

This project originally began as my very first programming project ever. The company I was employed at back then staffed many data analysts who had a fair amount of statistical conversions and math they needed to do on a day to day basis. As these things go, everyone had their own methods for doing these conversions, from Excel to Mathematica, to old fashion handheld calculators.

Thus I made a super basic HTML / CSS / JS page that did the math in a consistent, standardized manner. It eventually grew into a hare brained Electron app because I didn't know any better. This is the origin of the name "Project Orbital".

The repo has now been reborn as a Django, React app that does the original conversions and so much more, serving as an all in one office productivity application. I wont pretend it does any of its tasks like To-Do lists, Pomodoro timing, or mathematics any better than any other app, but it has been an opportunity to learn and try my hand at these sorts of common problems along with showcasing the significant amount I've learned since building my very first website. If you want to see true horror look through older parts of the commit log....
