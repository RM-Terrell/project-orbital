# Project Orbital

This project originally began as my very first programming project ever.The company I was employed at then staffed many data analysts who had a fare amount of statistical converstions and math they needed to do on a day to day basis. As these things go, everyone had their own methods for doing these conversions, from Excel to Mathematica, to old fashion calculators.

Thus I made a super basic HTML / CSS / JS page that did the math in a consistent manner. It eventually grew into a hare brained Electron app because I didnt know any better. This is the origin of the name "Project Orbital". Yeah I'm a bit of a nerd.

The repo has now been reborn as a Django, React, Webpack app that does the original conversions and so much more, serving as an all in one office productivity application.

Features (some still in development):
- Note taking
- Todo list
- Pomodoro timer
- Calculator inspired by Windows 10's built in calculator
- Stats conversions

And more to come.

Technologies leveraged:
- Django and Python
- Selenium
- Jest
- React and React Router
- Babel
- Webpack
- CSS Grid
