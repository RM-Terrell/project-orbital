# Future work ideas

- client side validation of inputs that result in errors on the backend for calculations. Things like the lower bound being bigger than the upper bound for Confidence Interval conversions. Would be nice to just get a client side error for this before bouncing it off the REST API.

- Cypress end to end testing
