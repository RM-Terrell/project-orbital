# Dev Conventions

Follow the rules nerd.

For JavaScript follow all rules in the `.eslintrc.json` file. For python follow PEP8 except with a 119 character line length because we dont code on CRT monitors anymore. Or at least I hope not. ESLINT Rules change as I see fit.

These rules are easy to integrate into vscode's UI using the eslint and python extensions, and other editors have ways too. No excuses.

For HTML id's and classes uses dashes (tacks) in between name elements. Example:

```html
<output type="number" id="result-other-perc-value" />
```

You break tests, you get put in the time out corner.
